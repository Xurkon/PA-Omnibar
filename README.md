# OmniBar (Project Ascension Beta)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a **BETA** release for Project Ascension. We have implemented fixes for combat taint and sparse array sort errors.
>
> **HELP WANTED:** We need players to help test this in various combat scenarios (Arenas, Battlegrounds, and World PvP). Please report any Lua errors or issues where cooldowns do not appear correctly.
>
> **UPDATE:** This version no longer requires the `!!!ClassicAPI` library. It now includes native polyfills for better compatibility with Project Ascension.
